# BeautifyTextV2
Welcome to BeautifyTextV2! This version of the project transforms your poorly formatted text files into beautifully formatted HTML files. You can choose the color for your subtitles, and BeautifyTextV2 will handle the rest.

# How to Use
Using BeautifyTextV2 is simple:

Mark your titles in the text file with asterisks (*).
Run the BeautifyTextV2 script on your text file.
Choose your preferred color for subtitles when prompted.
The script will output an HTML file with your text, beautifully formatted with your chosen subtitle color.
Please note that the output is an HTML file. To view the formatted text with colors, open the HTML file in a web browser.
